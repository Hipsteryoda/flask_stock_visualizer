# Intro
This app is still in development.

This application largely is intented to be a tool for technical analysis on stocks. Functionalities include collecting historical data on stocks, optimizing single and multi simple moving average (`sma`), optimizing exponential moving average (`exp_ma`), calculating peak multiples on investment using these different strategies, and visualizing their performance. Future funtionalities are intented to be news article summarization and sentiment analysis, further technical analysis options, and automated trading.

The core of this application is written in Python.


# Ideas for functionality
1. Trend charts page shows summarized articles 
2. Visualize buy and sell indicator points in showLineChart page
3. Buy/sell prompts on stocks (to lead to automated trading)
